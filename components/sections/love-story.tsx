            Vince and Era’s story didn’t begin with a simple “Hi” or “Hello.”
It began with… a Personal Data Sheet.
Yes, you read that right.
<br />
<br />
LinkedIn who? 😭
<br />
<br />  
Sometime in late 2023, Vince already knew of Era—her name, her face.
Enough to make an impression. Enough to make him quietly think,
👀 “Siya na 'to.”

            <p>
            Era, on the other hand?
Clueless. Living her life. Thriving. Unbothered.
<br />
<br />
Fast forward to the last few days of January—
Era officially joined the Department of Agriculture.
And just like that, the girl Vince once only knew on paper
became his colleague.

Work. Papers. Deadlines.
Walang halong landi. Promise.
<br />
<br />
Until Valentine’s Day came.

            Assigned at the Receiving Section, Era was simply doing her job when Vince approached her and said,
“Ma’am, pa-receive.”
<br />
<br />
Very work-appropriate…
except the “document” turned out to be a Goya chocolate tucked inside an envelope, with a small note:
Happy Valentine’s Day.
<br />
<br />
Smooth? Medyo.
Halata? Slightly. 😂

            From there, things slowly unfolded—
from casual office encounters to quiet sabay-uwi moments.
<br />
<br />
Both from Taguig (convenient 👀), Vince—who was staying at the DA dorm—started joining Era on her commute, casually saying it was because he “missed his mom.”
(We all know… hindi lang si mother ang dahilan 😌)

        text={

            <p>
            And then came one of the most unforgettable moments of their story—
GMA-Kamuning Station.
<br />
<br />
Out of nowhere, Era said:
“Wag mo ako bentahan ng insurance ah.”
<br />
<br />
Aray.
<br />
<br />
Imagine getting rejected…
sa bagay na hindi mo naman ino-offer. 😭
<br />
<br />
Because what Era didn’t know was this—
Vince was never offering something temporary.
<br />
<br />
Hindi insurance.
Hindi panandalian.
            </p>
          </>

            <p>
            What he was offering…
was a lifetime.
A love that stays.
A choice he would make—every single day.
<br />
<br />
Maybe hindi agad nakita ni Era.
Hindi agad naramdaman.
<br />
<br />
But through every sabay-uwi,
every small moment,
every quiet effort—
<br />
<br />
she slowly found herself choosing him, too.
<br />
<br />
Until one day, it wasn’t confusing anymore.
<br />
<br />
From a name on a piece of paper,
he became her person.
Her constant.
Her home.
